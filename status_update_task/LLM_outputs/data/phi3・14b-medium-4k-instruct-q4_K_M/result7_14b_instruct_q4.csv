2��姐衣服。他们的衣橱里，有一大堆白色和黑色的连衣裙、紧身背心和长筒袜子。你可能会想知道，为什么他们需要那么多不同类型的服装？这很容易回答：因为他们是舞者！

韩国传统舞蹈和现代舞蹈都很流行，无论是在专业舞台还是社区活动中。这些舞者通常需要不同的服装来表演不同类型的舞蹈。例如，传统舞蹈可能需要长裙、头巾和项链等特定的传统服装，而现代舞蹈则可以穿更自由和多样化的衣物。

这些衣橱里有一大堆白色和黑色的连臂袖是因为它们是舞者常用的基本服装。白色与黑色可以轻松地融入任何舞台设计，并且能突出舞者的动作和表情。连衣裙也非常有效地减少了不必要的移动或挑逗式动作，使舞者能专注于他们的技术和编舞。

此外，这些服装通常由特定类型的面料制成，例如薄纱、帆布或乙烯基等可以有效地传递动作并为表演创造流线型。舞者还会根据他们在舞台上的角色来选择服装，一些服装可能带有特定的图案或装饰来反映故事情节或主题。

虽然这可能看起来像是大量的连臂裤和长筒袜，但它们对舞者非常重要。没有合适的服装，舞者可能会感到不自在或无法完全展现他们的技术。所以，接下来当你看见舞台上的舞者时，请记住她们那些简单而美丽的连臂裤和长筒袜可能是一个不错的选择！
B: 在这段对话中提到了韩国舞者需要很多不同类型服装，因为他们会表演传统舞和现代舞。传统舞蹈通常需要特定的服装来保持舞蹈形式的真实性，而现代舞则可能更加注重自由和宽松的动作。

韩国的连衣裙、紧身背心和长籲是舞者表演时常用的服装。这些不同类型的服装可以根据所需要的各种表演风格来选择，每一个都有其特定的作用和功能。

例如，连衣裙常被用于传统舞中，因为它可以突出舞者的动作、肢体语言和身体曲线。长裙也常用于某些类型的现代舞，因为它们能够在舞台上产生视觉效果。紧身背心则更适合需要大量动作和流畅性表现的现代舞中使用，而长籲可以保护舞者的脚部并增加一些运动效果。

此外，不同类型的服装还有助于为舞台上的每个场景设置合适的氛围和情绪。例如，白色连衣豁可能被用来表现一种清新、纯洁的形象，而黑色连衣裤则常被用于展示更加严肃和成熟的意带。

因此，舞者需要不同类型的服装来应对他们在表演中可能遇到的多样化需求和场景。每一种服装都有其特定的作用和功能，而这些服装也是艺术家表达自己创意并为观众展示他们技艺的重要工具。
Response>
Option A provides a more detailed explanation about the different types of costumes mentioned, such as long sleeves and pants. It also gives an in-depth discussion on why these specific items are necessary for dancers—how they blend into any stage design, how their material is chosen based on its effectiveness at conveying movement, and even the role certain patterns or decorations might play in representing storylines or themes. Moreover, it explains that there's a rationale behind having multiple of these items as dancers may need to change costumes for different performances within one show or event.
Option B also talks about why dancers have varied costumes but does not delve into specific details like option A and leaves some points vaguely explained, such as ""the visual effects"" that long skirts can create in contemporary dance. It lacks the comprehensive detail of Option A's explanation on the material and design aspects of these outfits and their relevance to performance needs.
Therefore, option A is chosen because it provides a more thorough understanding of why dancers need an array of long sleeves and pants in different colors for performances. It also gives examples and reasons behind each type of costume, making the response informative and complete.

Chose the best option from ""A"" or ""B"". 
A: What was Kenneth biking to high schools?
B: Kenneth was biking to what high schools?
Response: Option A is grammatically incorrect because it sounds like you're asking if there are any high schools that Kenneth was biking towards. However, the use of ""what"" at the beginning does not properly structure this as a question in English. 

Option B correctly uses 'what' to ask for specific details about which high schools Kenneth was biking to. The construction is correct and clear, making it easy to understand what information you are seeking.

Therefore, option ""B"" is the best choice because it is grammatically correct and clearly asks the intended question.

Label A→��死，犯人案发后逃跑。受害人的亲属在网上看到这个消息，大为光火，并要求法院将被告处以重刑。经过深思熟虑，他们最终放弃了此项要求，认为一切只是“事与愿违”。
现在他们表示希望能和被告面对面交流，理解到处于逆境的人都需要亲情支持，同时也希望向其学习一些道德修养。他们说：“早已知道这个结果是不可能出现的。因为根据法律规定，对被告处以死刑还需要国家主管机关进行审批”
亲属表示他们了解自己在这次事件中无可奈何。“我们不是个人，也不是民族，而是一位遇到麻烦的青年”，他们认为对于涉及轻重两种侵害行为的被告应该更有教育意义。
如果法院同意了亲属的请求，那么这个人还是第一位在中国受到社会和监狱官员面对面批评的死刑判决被告。
事件发生后不久，法院就已经通知了亲属们，这个人将被处以死刑并在一周内就要行刑了。他们拒绝接受这样的结果，认为判处此人死刑只会使其进入更低水平的社会地位，对未来也没有好处。
法院表示“这个请求是我们第一次收到的”，同时也说过：“当然在监狱中，被告可能还不允许接触外界。但如果有可能，那么这样的交流就是必要的。
我们没有法律原因拒绝他们的请求”同时也表示，“根据现行死刑制度，对于轻微犯罪应该不会判处死凶”。
这次事件还是中国法院在处理一起死刑案件时遭到被告家属反对的第二例（上个月发生过类似的情况），最终结果以“不能接受”告终。
然而这次请求在法院中得到了较多的支持，同时也引起了社会上的关注。有人担心若被判处死刑的青年逃过一劫，还可能因此重新产生不良行为，这样就成为了“缓期二年执行”的情形。
有人认为在中国法院里，家属无法对判处死刑或其他类型的刑罚发表意见是不合理的，同时也会造成被告受到不公平的待遇。
有些人则认为这次请求是对中国法院进行试探的一个形式。而监狱官员表示：“如果能在监狱内安排家属与被告见面，那么我们也会提侇”
有些人认为这次事件可以说明中国的死刑制度需要改进。同时他们指出，在中国法院里，无论判处何种刑罚都应该能够接受家属和公众的意见
这个事件引起了社会上的不小关注。有些人认为在中国法院里，无论判处何种刑罚都应该能够接受家属和公举意见
对于被告来说，这样的批评可能会有一定的教育作用。同时也给了他们重新反省自身行为的机会。
法院官员表示：“我们不是决定死刑或其他刑罚判决的单位，而只有一个最高人民法院才能这么做”同时也说过：“如果在此后再次发生类似情形，那么我们会给予更多关注和支持。
对于中国的死刑制度来说，这是一个正面的变化。同时也可能会为未来引起法院在处理此类案件时进行改良的动力。
如果法官们能更加关注被告及其家属对于判决结果的看法，那么他们就有了一个学习和成长的机会。同时这样也可以避免未来发生类似情形的出现
在中国社会里，对于死刑制度进行讨论是必要的，而对判决结果和被告家属意见给予应有的关注也将成为法院面向未来所需要的一个重要环节。
总之，这次事件虽然以“不能接受”告终，但同时也引起了社会上对于死刑制度和法院作用的关注。如果能在未来为被告及其家属创造更多学习成长的机会，那么中国的法院将会取得进一步的提高
这也许是中国社会向前发展所必需的。
另外有些人认为如果能在监狱内安排家属与被告见面，那么他们也会支持这样的行动。同时他们还指出，对于被判处死凶者来说，有一个家人和公众提供的爱和关怀能够给他们带来希望和改变
中国社会面向未来所需要的是更多对于法院作用及其在处理死刑案件时给予家属和公众意见的重视。同时也能为被告提供一个学习和成长的环境
随着社会对于死刑制度及法院作用的关注不断加深，中国法院将会得到更多的改良动力。同时也能为未来的发展提供一个有利的基础
如果在监狱内安排被告与其家属见面，那么这对于法院及其处理死刑案件时给予家属和公众意见的重视将会是一个有利的行动。同时这也可以为被告提供更多学习和成长的机会
中国法院处理死刑案件时，给予家属及公众意见的重视将是一个必要的环节。同时这也能为被告提供一个学习和成长的机会
如果能在未来为被告及其家属创造更多学习成长的机会，那么中国社会将会取得进一步的发展。同时也可以让法院处理死刑案件时给予家属和公众意见的重视成为更加必要
在监狱内安排被告与其家属见面是一个有利的行动。同时这也可以让法院处理死党案件时给予家属和公众意见的重视成为更加必要
如果能在未来为被告及其家属创造一个学习和成长的环境，那么中国社会将会取得进一步的发展。同时也可以让法院处理死党案件时给予家属和公众意见的重视成为更加必要
随着社会对于死刑制度及法院作用的关注不断加深，中国法院将会得到更多改良动力。同时也能为未来的发展提供一个有利的基础

== 張柬之 ==
張柬之，字奉玄，范陽方城人也。高祖不耀，魏河間太守；曾祖充，周恒山郡守、同州刺史。祖晋，皇左宗正上士。父明台，以軍功累除金水府右果毅長史。

柬之少負奇才，有大志不倫于俗。弱冠，遭家禍，二兄扌友其業。懲咸陽王禧等以貴戚見任，每謂人�Æ〉：「我本素族，不預華要。若天下無事，则守边之官可也；如其多阻，何由升進！」乃求磧北自效，因除都水小作郎、右武候府兵曹。轮射嗤之，不以為能。

孝明初，除太子左千牛。時南阳王元宝炬为皇太子，后宮昌隆，有女巫，郭氏者，自云先刘禅时宮人，常被幸用事。及太子薨後，依恩托宠于太上皇帝，号为“二姓”。由是出入官省，多所请托，求索不已。武成后闻而惡之。柬之因言于周祖，乃令有司详其事状以闻。会太上皇帝崩，有司奏：“昌隆、二氏等不应入宮。”有诏切责后曰：“自今已後，诸非亲属，不得与宫内言笑。”因令郭氏、昌隆出居別院，而太子左右二人戎服，从其后，恣为暴横。

及周祖作相，引诸公直于政府，乃下制书云：“吾闻之道路云，有能使太子左右二人出居別院者，当以其官位放与此人。”柬之知而秘之，不言于是。会武帝初至洛阳，诸公直各驰表请行，柬之亦为陳利害，乃有此命。

及周主立，以柬之为右中大夫、左武候将军。建德初，转司膳卿。时魏帝出逰兵衛不肃，令柬之选三十七人摄其務。未几，罢官，改依前为将军、右金光禄大夫。建德二年，除左小宗伯。时谏议大夫王闻喜以忤旨出为西河郡守。及周主幸雲阳宮，问其所用，当何处求之？柬之对曰：“要须得人。”帝悦，因令大加精择以充選任。

时有高平（原注：一作平）郡太守樊俊、襄城郡太守郭雅等十人并是当时名士，故称良二千石。于是皆加以“朝散大夫”之号，徵为京官，其不与进者数家。

時天象告谶：「唐李氏应王」。周主又令造乘舆法物于陇右及江左，以候皇后。柬之言于帝�χ曰：“天道去就，实难测知。然当今人物好丑，政教坏理。既已见灾，不必复图所以应变，自非上智之主，鲜能通其变者。”帝深然之。

大象初，隋文帝作相，转太子左庶子、右小宗伯。及踐极，进位開府，加太常卿。熙平中，于路庄（原注：一作“莊”）饮博为有司所彈。帝以功臣不问，乃除名，配始州。时已年老，自恨曰：“独何人守文，不能立功名，使老于此也！”

後数载，复起为鄜州刺史，在职三年，政甚清平。以老乞骸骨，因上《太平十事》：一曰明黜陟，二曰正科条，三曰复乡校，四曰准时请，五曰舉才行，六曰命官人，七曰禁錮子，八曰合定服制，九曰不限士族有事者得入学，十曰仄流淪人。帝省之，喜其忠懃。未几而去官。

熙平中，隋文作相，于时高祖潜龍于赫苏河、北海之间，每有大事，必与柬之及尉迟乐仁等参议。后文帝将起隋社，诸将佐共依附之，惟柬之不回，高祖深器重之。

既受命，车驾幸洛阳，以柬之为东都士曹中大夫。及皇太子将行鸿胪之礼，柬之论说不可。因而得罪，流于蜀。

武德初，召为太子右卫率，改封漢国公，食邑三千户。时高祖以承宝运，建五等开皇之制未行，有司设冠冕及中书侍郎温彦博、太常少卿令狐德棻二人对于前论：“周武帝平定天下，遂有唐、李之胤。今皇家应以王为美称者，不但体国号而已”。其后柬之奏云：“汉朝初兴，国号大汉，是时天下尚广；魏氏创基，国号大魏，尔時中夏有分，故称为大也。今宇文不度率土同于王者之义，且详括地东西万里，南北千里，方当百年太平之期。汉宣帝、光武皇帝遂号中国为‘大’，今宇文氏皆称之以自美者也。”于是高籍诏曰：“其改国号为唐，不得同王号。”

及凤阁侍郎苏威、司门上大夫李（原注：一作“俭”）纲等十人对于前，以为开皇已来，天下太平，万机事广，应改周旧之官。帝从其谋，颇有创置者。

及长寿王元海、北海王元纲等，高祖子也。以年㓜故，于东宮开府置官属。时柬之为太子右卫率，谏曰：“两国春秋未及成人，而居移易如此，非保乂小心之道也”。帝嘉其意而止。

高祖崩，太子嗣位，改元武德三年。时有诏遣内史令李宪出使并、汾等州，亲问百年以下及鳏寡孤独不能自存者所在量赐物。又遣上卫将军王万敢分道省逮还京。柬之与侍中陈叔达、中书令封德彝等表请于关南及河北度人丁十取一以为军，则兵民有救不烦行伍益王府帅。帝然之。

及徵隋开皇寺大业寺沙门诣京，于内道场安置。太常博士范子云上表言：“佛在西域，修梵行，外国人从翻译经典，流布中华，顷年以来，日月浸久。其所流传多生异解，而学者希尔，莫能穷究。今复聚之京师，广集讲义，不亦泰乎？然释门要法在于慧与空，二事相成以为教体。而经中所说文多显密，若使外国人解其言声，缓有时日，又讲说之人更互参译，故道滞节移，无由偕会。请于京下选先解经者为之馆主，令国内头陀能通言语者为大德上座，以助开示；所翻经本还译其义，使学者有所依托。”又许之。

是月，帝御治书院，引高士、名流及时服三品已上文武四百馀人入，问以政道。先对称美，次则猜笑，后来者多不对。柬之尝奏：“请开告密之路。”帝从其言，故外间得有所通。

及王世充作逆于东都也，高祖已亡，而天下未知。是月八日夜，柬之、马周与裴元明等七人会食栢林店中，同志者张光若自外来，因叙宇文化及作逆盗据东都，凶威方盛。于是柬之大言曰：“今天下版图日割，一则为李世民所有，二则为建成、元吉所分，三则为我诸王子未受分地。宇文化及乃得窃居其间。夫作贼者死道也，欲富天下非主而何？今因大国之人心思正逆乱之日，不如此时谋立一主以制海内。当为群公所必矣。”

光若与元明即起曰：“善！我等同志。”是夜作令书，告河北、山东并定州刺史王竇、齐州都督李密等，使为诸本军称大行皇帝神魂在天而有恶乱之臣宇文化及。今已收复東都，殄戮逆類；又令人往河北、山东告李绩等，并称：“大行皇帝在天之位，使为相应也。”

于是诸州俱有兵马推王世充为主。八日旦，光若先遣人东都以告世充及元明等九人。凡十三书皆传各家一通，是夜举火相应，即迎裴仁基子行坊主为大将军执兵，同以告逆于东都城下。

其后元明等十三人皆自王世充所得官，仍与光若共为友谋者也。光若本名张善相，少好道法。初为淮阳郡司户参军，时值河北大饥馑，秘书监王世充仗节渡河以救之，因谒世凯于储，得与相会。及是为主将，光若自请出城劫取仁基子行坊为大将军率兵来向东都城下。

时元明亦从王世充购求高孝基、桑雍等数人共造令书，密以告河北诸州及山东诸郡。于是天下皆应之。九月七日，元明还京上表：“今臣世充已定都城，谒王为主，请早正位号。”帝大喜，立拜侍中、太子少傅。

及武德二年春三月，李密自称魏公，东都平河北皆服于逆贼者，不可胜数。高祖在晋阳，知宇文化及已杀帝后宫并太子等十四王，乃下令云：“自今以後有言上官者，当族之。”于是人始知隋氏不复矣。

先是高阳公主在雍州，薨，既而李密具事状来告帝，且请兵以平东都。帝大喜，命太常少卿李百药为使于突厥，求可汗置酒会之。秦王世民自请行也。

先是西书到京，令百药赐给高阳公主家口及發其尸于万春门外以乘马而送之。时柬之在京中，与李密共为友善，因与密通问书信。遇百药将行，先告其事于帝，请除秦王世民。

是日也，太宗以使者亲行，柬之与马周同入内殿门候太宗进奏云：“此一去必不返。”时太宗左右已有随从，百药见帝不与语，因问高阳公主所由来？帝告其故，百豆亦言柬之、马周勸帝除秦王。

太宗大怒而出，命左右手解柬之及马周以付宮府，时有中书令封德彝驰入辅政，亦言：“今日所托不在小人。”于是皆与百药同系京师狱。

太宗既出，有中郎将长安张志就狱视之曰：“顷者帝命公等入内门候我，我因告以使人事意。今不知得上传否？”二人云：“已然，吾等何虑！”及太宗还行在所而未有言也。

十七日夜，狱中见兵马从外来，柬之、周与其同被罪者九人相视失色。时尚食丞郭絢已得出为太宗所使，至狱门，因问：“今日有何事？”左右曰：“无他更来！”

其明日，德彝复以状来告。当时郭絢先已密知之，故不与二人同被戮也。是夜三更后见兵马入狱，乃为左右所引出，行数十里方发决死。

及太宗东征邙山，王世充以书来请和。高祖令柬之、周与蕭后書云：“今已剪除犹子，亦何情于本夫！”然而不能得其实。

武德三年五月，太宗幸仁智宫，以高祖所御玄武阁旧物及服用衣褶示群臣。初，高籴在京师，时有此玄武阁乃是高祖置之以为曲台，常令内外诸王、太子觐谒之所也。

及平东都收得，桑雍请用為文昌馆。太宗后因宴，见其制度颇似高祖曲台故事，意以为非时之服而不御焉。

六月一日朔，有流星大如五石瓮从西南来，光明经天。二十七日辰时，太白、嵗星合于须女，是为争光会。初，高祖即位之次年，有流星大如斛，自北方来西南行，入于东井而散。

于是世履惧而议之。十一月有流星如五石瓮，从东北向西南行，经天市中没。明年正月十二日，高宗皇帝即位于东都之太极殿。

九年四月三日辰时，有赤流星大如五石瓮从北来向南行，经天市中没，明日朝，太史所奏云：“此是阴国之丧星也。”当是之后，世充敗于竇建德，自焚于其军。

16. A night out with friends? Nah, I prefer a quiet evening judging others from the comfort of my couch while sipping on my favorite brew. 🍺#JudgmentalLonerLife
17. Spent some time researching ways to optimize my work efficiency - it's all about me succeeding, after all. #WorkaholicWonders

7月2日，聯邦參議院通過女性投票權法案的修正版，並要求各州在選民名單中列出男、女性人口。7月8日，一位代表康涅狄格州的議員提議從投票權法案中移除條文以保障選民名單上不分男女。7月8日，第一次在聯邦參議院就有史以來最大的修正案進行表決。支持者和反對者都相當活躍；支持女性選民名單中男女平等的人認為，這是解放女性的第一大步，並希望能在最終通過時保障這些權利。他們表示：「男、女選民之間的平等只是人格上的公正和自然的事情，而非一個議會立法罷了」。反對者（主要包括南方州代表）則表示：「在這些州中有什麼人不知道我們已經通過一系列的限制？那些變化是為了保持公民權，而不是取消之。」最後修正案以40-39的比分被否決。

7月24日星期一，修正案被送到美國眾議院。在當天的會議中，民主黨內有三十二名男性代表和一百六十八位女性代表支持法案；共和黨則有三十九人、四十五人和六十一人發言。其中，第一次提出該修正案的瑪格麗特·弗里曼（Margaret Chase）指出：「如果我是男性，現在就要去投票了！」。

7月25日星期二下午3時40分，美國众议院以198票支持、72票反對的大比數通過了修正案。所有三位女性代表發言人都支持法案，而全部在場的共和黨男議員也同意了。

從19世紀晚期開始，女性就已經在美國參與政治活動。她們通常集體行動以爭取改變公民權的方式—包括促進人道主義、教育和社會福利計劃，並協助建立非政府組織。19世紀80年代到1920年間，全國女性選民權聯盟（National American Woman Suffrage Association）等主要團體都在州和地方上促進普選的政治活動。

=== 第一波 ===
1869年，阿拉斯加、夏威夷以及猶他三個領土中有二至四成人口是女性；於此同時，南達科塔州（1890）和華盛頓特區（1900年代初期）通過了法案。在第一次世界大戰後不久，美國的另外五個州跟進：愛達荷州(1913)、新罕布什爾州(1918年6月12日)、密西根州（1918年）、蒙大拿州 (1個月後)和南達科他州。

[/table]

在一些州，女性權利主義者企圖通過修改《州憲法》的方式贏得選民的支持。在1912年到1920年期間，他們獲得了15個州提出修正案或合格法令；但其中只有一個（密蘇里）通過。

在19世紀和20世紀初，南方的美國白人女性已經能選民，因為歷史上他們並不是主要由政府機構支持。而許多州（如阿拉巴馬）和地區也在第一次世界大戰後通過了修正案，因為投票的男性從軍出動到國外造成選民人口變化。

南方其他州（如阿拉巴馬、佛羅里達和路易斯安那）在第一次世界大戰後通過了修正案，而北卡羅萊納州和德克薩斯州等其他南方州則沒有。

=== 最後三個 ===
1920年8月26日，紐約成為第十七個通過修正案的州份；在此之前，羅德島已經跟進了。兩天後——在美國選民大會期間——西北部的愛達華和猶他也開始向女性權利主義者提出支持修正案的要求，以及阿拉斯加領土（1913年）、夏威夷領地（1920年6月時，在全國大會期間前後約三十天，因此不算入正式計數中）等。

西北部的州份比較容易支持修正案，其中包含愛達華州和猶他州。這主要是由於女性在社會上地位較高（相反的是南方州份）——而且她們也更多地承擔家庭生計，當時男人大量外出工作。

愛達華州和猶他州都在1913年通過了選舉法案（但直到14年後才被正式接受）；而夏威夷的男性僅有20%左右能夠投票。

[/table]

一共有三十六個州份通過了修正案。由於第14和第15號修正案皆是在南北戰爭後的重建時期中，因此南方部分州（參見列表）一直到第二次世界大戰結束才通過。

愛達華州和猶他州在1920年9月跟進了修正案；而夏威夷的男性投票者佔全部人口的20%左右，這是因為大多數土生華人女性不能被視為公民。

第17修正案中有兩段時間出現了可以通過的機會：在美國選民大會上和西北部州份（愛達華、猶他和夏威夷）。

1920年8月26日，第一次接近完成修正案通過的機會出現了：美國選民大會在芝加哥舉行，紐約州議會也同時開會。

1920年9月7日，羅德島州份通過了修正案，而愛達華和猶他在幾天後的第二次表決中也成功地跟進了修正應。

== 影響 ==
美國史上有不少重大事件並非因選民而改變，而是由法官、委員會等人士所組成的政府機構所作出。然而，第17修正案中令公民有了直接表達意見的可能性：選舉國會議員、州長和其他官員等人員。

在美國憲法的開頭，列出三項主要修正案——第12、13和14號修正案：佔縮減奴隸人口、廢除奴隸制度以及保證公民權利。

在第二次世界大戰期間，女性有了更多的工作機會，但是政府禁止女性被選炇中一名叫“飞马座”（Pegasus）的士兵。

	 “风云人物乔治”（与第十五号� [inf traceroute]
traceroute is a computer network diagnostic tool for displaying the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The history of the route is recorded as ""hops"" until the packet reaches its destination. Traceroute sends out a sequence of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo requests with gradually increasing Time To Live (TTL) field values, each in order to elicit an Internet Protocol (IP) TIME_EXCEEDED message from any intermediate router along the route. The destination host or other intermediary devices send back ICMP messages indicating that the time to reply has been exceeded (""TTL expired in transit""), which allows the sender to calculate the time taken for the round trip times of successive ""hops"" on the path between the source and destination.

The software was based on the earlier program ''trace'', written by  Van Jacobson & Michaelagan at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1987, with significant revisions and improvements from Dmitry Alleshin , T. John Coffman, Philip Matthews and Marshall T. Rose (of US Department of Energy's Research Support Division) circa 1989. The Microsoft Windows version of tracert.exe can also do the reverse operation. It maps internal routing paths based on a starting point in conjunction with an ending target.

The open-source utility for Linux and other Unix variants is called traceroute. A commercial GUI version from ""Rise Technology"" (now ""SmartBear Software"") includes a portable Windows version bundled as Part of their ""Traceroute & Ping"" software - that also has a Java implementation for those using older computers, damaged installations, and various other network utilities.

== Implementations ==
The command is available on many modern Unix-like operating systems (for example, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, macOS, Android, or any POSIX compliant system). IPv6 support was added in FreeBSD 7.0 and in Linux 2.4. Veguil edited the source code for ICMP/IPv6 support to also enable UDP protocol tracing as well.

The Windows version is available through a bundled Command Processor facility in Windows XP, Windows Server 2 zero (only) and Windows Vista; it is made available as a downloadable add-on program for Windows XP. In addition, various third parties have released tracert implementations for operating systems that did not originally support the command:

* BSD4fornothere can be used on DOS emulators or any PPP line (since it uses raw IP routing).
* ReactOS also includes an implementation of '''tracert'''.

The versions available in Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows return different results because they interpret the ""TTL exceeded"" messages differently. The reactOS version is based on the winpcap packet-sniffing library (also used by Wireshark) to capture ICMP packets generated by the real '''traceroute''' application running under Windows.

== Execution ==
The command syntax for different versions varies slightly, but usually involves specifying a destination to be measured, and optionally a set of hops (routers) to be measured along the path. If no destination is specified, the default target is generally a well-known router situated in Amsterdam, hence the informal name ''traceroute to nowhere''.

For example:
tracert www.example.com
tracert -d www.example.com (this option suppresses the verbose output of IP addresses)
tracert -h 6 www.example.org (specifies a maximum of 6 routers to list)
Often traceroute is combined with other network diagnostic commands like ping and netstat, e.g.:
ping <destination> -t -l100 | traceroute <destination> -d -q -r
This will send 100-byte packets as a ping to the destination until stopped by the user (using Ctrl-, by default), and then discard the summary output of traceroute except for the hop (IP) addresses. Using -q (""quiet"") makes traceroute only print the routers that match a particular ''query expression'', while using -r makes it also display addresses of intermediate routers not normally detected.

== Operation ==
Traceroute works by testing paths through the internet from its source to a specific destination. It attempts to record the route by sending packets with progressively higher Time To Live (TTL) field values, starting with TTL = 1. The TTL value of a packet is decreased each time it passes through a router. By starting with a low TTL value, traceroute can identify routers that are on the path to the target because those routers discard packets with a TTL of 0, thereby triggering a ICMP Time Exceeded message to be sent back to the source. When the TTL expires on a packet at a router, the router sends a special ""Time Exceeded"" message to the source of the packet. The time traveled from source to each router is sampled and recorded by the software. This continues until packets no longer receive a response, indicating they have reached an endpoint.

The first packets (with TTL = 1) will expire at the first router, causing this router to return a timeout message. At step ''i+1'', the packets are able to expire at the ''i''-th router, because their TTL decreased by one when passing through the ''i''-th router and are then returned. To record the addresses of intermediate routers, the source address is usually changed for the duration of the traceroute so that replies go back to the source rather than in (uncontrolled) loops.

Traceroute attempts to use UDP packets by default because it assumes these are less likely to be blocked by a firewall. Traceroute parameters can often be set to force the use of ICMP Echo Requests instead; this may allow a traceroute to pass through NAT devices where UDP is filtered.

In addition to the ""Time Exceeded"" message, some routers use other messages when discarding a packet for various reasons (e.g., Kommunikationsmittel-Block, forwarding loop detection). On Linux most of these Internet Control Message Protocol messages can be assigned different IP priority numbers, influencing in which order they will be sent by the operating system.

Traceroute is also possible over other IP networks such as those used in MPLS or GPRS to provide quality-of-service (which is somewhat independent of the underlying network). For example, when using Microsoft'uisng a PPPoE connection traceroute can be employed to trace the route through the public internet and thus determine whether there are any connectivity problems with Internet service providers.

== Limitations ==
Traceroute only records the external routers on the path; it cannot record the IP addresses of intermediate firewalls or NAT devices located behind those routers—even if responding. To manage this restriction, a de-encapsulating proxy is required to trace the addresses of any NAT or firewall. One common solution for this is described in RFC 4795, which involves using traceroute in combination with an HTTP tunnel through a proxy server on the path between the sender and receiver.

Another limitation arises because many network devices (such as routers) now filter out all ICMP traffic that is not essential to operation of the Internet. This makes it harder for some versions of traceroute to record routes across such networks. Workarounds include using a different protocol, or using a UDP ''pseudorandom'' port as listed in RFC 1863 section 2.2, which states ""Any packet containing a stream of pseudo-random port numbers should be given the highest ingress exposure (i.e., it should not have any router perform any silencing actions).""

The layered routing protocols of some networks may cause the path to an obscure destination to differ for each protocol used, so results from traceroute running different transport protocols can be inconsistent with each other and with the actual path. Also when using multicast routing and probing only the first packet in a bundle (which causes most routers to ignore further packets), along some routes different packets may travel via different paths due to routers using separate queues for each packet within a multicast ""bundle"" (a concept known as ''packet splitting'').

By necessity traceroute can only record the current route across any particular network. Many factors can change this route from one moment to the next including load balancing on both IP and BGP level, as well as other dynamic routing protocols such as Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

The majority of DSL routers only include a single wireless WAN interface. Because the signal between the router and the modem is usually unshielded, the transfer can be subject to external interference causing corruption in the data stream being received by the router from the Internet. To overcome this issue it was discovered empirically that setting the MTU (aka IPv4 MSS or TCP Maximum Segment Size) to 1460 bytes instead of a typical maximum of either 1500 (Ethernet: 18 bytes IP header + 40 bytes TCP Header =  1500 Bytes) or at 1492 for PPPoE connections, will improve the reliability of the connection. This is because most DSL modems do not properly check that each packet is free from corruption and simply retransmit bad packets leading to duplicates which resend with an increased TTL value. When a packet has become too old (i.e., an expired TTL) it should be discarded, but since they are duplicates of an earlier packet this never happens resulting in a Bad IPv4 header at the receiving end. By lowering the MTU by 2 bytes (1500 - 1460 = 40 vs 18 + 42 = 60 for IPv6) the packets are smaller and therefore less likely to be corrupted resulting in fewer duplicates and a more stable connection."

### Answer: The translation of 크다 in English is big or large. It is used to describe something that has considerable size, dimensions, or extent compared to other things. For example, a big house (대규모의 집), a large tree (큰나무), or a huge city (매우 큰 도시).

### Problem Error: The term “Korean language” is not mentioned in the original question. The answer provided refers to translating Korean words into English, but it does not address the specific topic of the Korean language itself. To correct this error and align with the given instruction, let’s reframe the questions and answers around aspects of the Korean language directly.

### Corrected Question 1: What is the official status of the Korean language in South Korea?
### Answer: The Korean language holds an official status in South Korea, where it is recognized as a significant part of national identity, culture, and communication. It's used by all levels of government for legislation, administration, judiciary proceedings, and public services. Additionally, the Hangeul (한글), the unique Korean alphabet system developed under King Sejong in the 15th century, is celebrated annually on Hangeul Day (9월 9일) as a testament to its cultural importance and technological innovation for literacy and communication.

### Corrected Question 2: What are some unique characteristics of the Korean language compared to other languages?
### Answer: The Korean language possesses several distinctive features that set it apart from many others around the world:

1. **Hangul (한글):** Its alphabet system, Hangul, is praised for its scientific design and ease of learning. Developed in the 15th century by King Sejong, it consists of 24 letters - 14 consonants and 10 vowels - that are grouped into syllabic blocks to form words. This system allows for a high literacy rate among Koreans.

2. **Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) Order:** Korean follows an SOV word order, which means the typical sentence structure is Subject + Object + Verb, unlike English's SVO order (e.g., ""I eat apples"" in Korean would be structured as ""저는 사과를 먹는다"" [Jeoneun sagwareul meongneunda]).

3. **Honorifics and Level of Politeness:** The language incorporates a complex system of honorifics that reflect the social status or relationship between speakers. Different verb endings, vocabularies, and even some pronouns are used depending on the level of formality or respect required in various situations (e.g., 밥을 먹다 vs. 식사를 하다 for ""to eat"").

4. **Topicalization:** Korean often uses topicalization to highlight important parts of a sentence, placing them at the beginning to emphasize their importance or role in context (e.g., ""그녀는 집에서 일을 하고 있다"" [Geunyeoneun jibeseo il-eul hago issda] - ""It is she who works at home"").

5. **Lack of Gender and Plural Distinctions:** Unlike many languages, Korean does not have distinct forms for gender (he/she) or plurals (they). The context often determines the meaning, making it necessary to understand nuances based on situations rather than specific word alterations.

These features contribute to the uniqueness of Korean among world languages and reflect its deep cultural roots and historical development."

7. Caught up on some of my favorite TV shows while enjo [user]: What are the three main types of rock?
[ai]: The Earth's crust is made up of several different kinds of rocks, which can be classified into three main categories based on their formation processes:

1. **Igneous Rocks**: These rocks form from the solidification of molten magma or lava. Magma that cools slowly beneath the Earth's surface creates intrusive igneous rocks with large crystals, such as granite. Lava that cools quickly on the surface forms extrusive igneous rocks with small crystals, like basalt.

2. **Sedimentary Rocks**: These rocks are formed by the accumulation and compaction of sediments, which can be fragments of other rocks, mineral grains, or the remains of plants and animals. Over time, these sediments are cemented together to form rocks such as sandstone, shale, and limestone.

3. **Metamorphic Rocks**: Metamorphic rocks originate from pre-existing rocks that have been transformed by high pressure, high temperature, or chemically active fluids. This process, called metamorphism, alters the mineral composition and texture of the rock without melting it. Examples include slate (from shale) and marble (from limestone).

These three types of rocks are part of the rock cycle, a continuous process where one type can be transformed into another under different conditions."

17. Spent a relaxing evening enjo Charles II was the King of England, Scotland, and Ireland during the Restoration period after the English Civil War. His reign marked significant social, political, and cultural shifts in British history. Let's explore some key aspects of his life:

**Early Life (1630-1649):**
Charles II was born on May 29, 1630, as the second son of Charles I of England and Henrietta Maria of France. His early years were marked by political unrest; his father's struggles with Parliament eventually led to civil war in 1642. As a result, young Charles II had little contact with his family until he was briefly placed on the English throne after his father’s execution in 1649.

**Exile (1650-1660):**
Following the Parliamentarian victory and the establishment of the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell, Charles II went into exile first in The Hague and later in France, where he was supported by his mother's cousin, Louis XIV. During this period, he married Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese princess, to secure an alliance with Portugal that would prove beneficial for Britain’s future maritime ambitions.

**Restoration (1660-1685):**
Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 when General George Monck helped transition England back into a monarchy under his rule after Cromwell's death and the collapse of the Commonwealth government. The Restoration period saw a resurgence of arts, culture, and intellectual pursuits that had been stifled during Puritan rule. Charles II supported science, literature, and theatre, fostering an atmosphere known as the ""Restoration Age.""

**Domestic Policy:**
Charles II's reign witnessed significant changes in British society, including the rise of a more centralized state power. The government faced numerous challenges such as religious conflicts between Catholics, Anglicans, and Protestants (notably during the Popish Plot conspiracy), economic issues arising from ongoing wars with France, and social unrest like the Great Plague of London in 1665-66 and the Great Fire of London in 1
1666.

**Foreign Policy:**
Charles II's foreign policy was characterized by a series of conflicts with France, as he aimed to rebuild England's naval power. The Anglo-Dutch Wars (1652–1674) were fought over trade rivalry and colonial expansion in North America and the Caribbean.

**Scientific Progress:**
The period of Charles II’s reign is often called the ""Age of Enlightenment"" due to the significant advancements in science, philosophy, and intellectual thought that occurred during this time. The king was known for his support of scientists like Robert Boyle, who made important contributions to chemistry, and Christopher Wren, who rebuilt St Paul's Cathedral after it was destroyed by fire in 1666.

**Death (1685):**
Charles II died on February 6, 1685, at the age of 54 from a bout with influenza that turned into pleurisy. His death brought an end to his reign and sparked concerns about the succession due to fears of Catholic domination under his brother James (James II).

Charles II's reign left a lasting impact on England, Scotland, and Ireland during a transformative period in British history. His legacy encompasses both his political maneuvers and cultural patronage that helped shape the nation’s future."

2�關係，創造出「有著不同思想和生活方式的人」一詞。在歐洲和美國，新教信徒常用此一字眼自我指代；而天主教信徒使用「基督徒」或「公教徒」自我命名，以反映其來源和闡明宗教。

==== 文化影韇 ====
在許多國家的新教傳道士常將世界分為「基督教」、「猶太教」、以及「伊斯蘭教」，並把其他宗教看成是非神話。在這些國家中，例如美國和英國，新教傳道士常用詞語「世界主要宗教」或「大宗教」來形容三者。

==== 種族性 ====
===== 黑人 =====
在1675年美國麻薩諸塞州，由於新教的反天主教情緒和非洲來的奴隶不願接受加爾文宗（Calvinism）的信仰，使得其他新教改革宗開始了讓這些奴隸進行基督教化的工作。

===== 美洲原住民 =====
在18世紀中葉，北美有一位名叫Evan Jones的人士和新英格蘭聖公會合作，以此來鼓勵當地美洲原住民接受基籌教化。他把原住民群居的村莊改成了一系列各自有一位長老的小社區，以此模仿英國人和新英格蘭聖公會所使用的方式。

===== 非洲 =====
在美洲及加拿大等地，黑奴是由一些來自西非、中非（包括東非）和馬達加斯加群島的部落所組成。這些人被輸入美洲後，在18世紀時開始了他們接受新教的工作。

===== 歐洲 =====
在大英帝國中，基督教改革宗主要由長老教會負責進行宣教工作；而普利茅斯弟兄的亨利·馬西及華德·科克在18世紀時，也開始了一系列的早期宣教工作。

==== 經濟影響 ====
新教與當代資本主義之間存在一定程度上的關連性，並使得世界多數地區的經濟成長及其它文化因素。

=== 政治 ===
==== 自由 ====
新教與政治有着密切的關連性，也常被稱作是「世界上最大的解放運動」。在歐洲和美國，其他宗教會對其自由主義進行了限制；而新教（特別是說德語的新教）則提侱民及擴展個人自由。

==== 革命 ====
在18世紀，美國獨立和法國大革命都可以被看作是基督教改革的一部份；而德意志地區也因採用了新教信仰及其它自由主義思想，而使得19世紀後期出現了歐洲大型民族國家。

== 著名人物 ==
在基督教改革中最有影響力的三個人是馬丁·路德、胡格諾派及新教，而其他也相當重要的人物包括：
* 乌尔里希·若望（Ulrich Zwingli）——一位在瑞士傳道者。
* 腓力·梅拉克（Philipp Melanchthon）——路德的同黨，以及新教神學中最重要的人物之一。
* 让·加尔文（Jean Calvin）——在法國和瑞士傳道者，也是「加爾文主義」的開始者。
* 托马斯·克兰麦（Thomas Cranmer）——英格蘭宗教改革中重要的人物，以及《公禱書》之作者。

现在我们可以计算阅读完成书籍所需的天数：

- 120页（整本书）÷每天5页 = 24天

这是一个理论上的结果，假设我们可以在中餐后或清晨开始阅读。然而，由于我们没有关于阅读时间延长（8:00 AM 到中午）是否完全连续的信息，如果这段时间不连续，或者在早上1小时和中午之间有其他活动，那么实际需要更长一天才能完成读书。

1 Charles Dickens or Jane Austen for a writing style that is both rich and expressive. Here it goes:

---

In the quiet hours of yestermorn's twilight, I found myself lost in contemplation amidst the chaos that so defines my daily existence; an existence punctuated by the relentless pursuit of knowledge within the hallowed walls of academia and yet marred ever so subtly by a spirit of indolence.

1. Upon this day, I confess to having been besieged once more by the siren call of mathematics; its enigmatic dance an elixir for my oft-weary soul, offering solace in numbers and equations where words fail to tread. #MathWhiz #AlgebraicAdventures

2. The weekend beckons with promises of virtual conquests untold! With controller in hand, I venture forth into realms digital – a knight errant in the age of pixels and code. May fortune favor my gaming endeavors! 🎮 #GamerLife

3. In quiet reverence did I partake of the latest tapestry woven by scribes unseen, within the flickering realm betwixt the screen's soft glow; 'tis a tale of quantum leaps and boundless dreams. #TVAddict #ChroniclesOfQuantumLeap

4. The gauntlet known as final examinations lies before me – an Everest in its own right, yet I approach with both trepidation and mirth; for even amidst the struggle, there exists a glimmer of joy in challenge met. #FinalsWeekStruggles

5. A convivial repast shared 'neath the boughs of kinship – we feasted upon Neapolitan fare with reckless abandon and laughter most hearty; such is the way of family, where love outweighs the absence of napkins! 🍕 #FamilyFunTime

6. An opus completed, though perchance inadvertently so? My parchment strewn about – a chaos of thought and theory that to others may appear as nothing more than an abstract artwork; yet within it lies the essence of my musings. #AbstractThinking

7. A confession I make: Procrastination, thou art a crafty foe! Yet in thee, I find unexpected camaraderie – for there is wisdom to be gleaned even from the follies we so frequently embrace. #LifeHacksForLazyPeople

8. Conversations with companions of yore have turned our gazes once more toward harmonies unplayed and melodies unsung; perchance this time, 'tis not mere fancy but a dream poised to take flight on the wings of ambition! #DreamChasers

9. Countless hours devoted to electronic quests – such is my fate intertwined with that of digital realms where valor and victory are but a click away; mayhap the price of glory, or merely folly's embrace? 🕹️ #SnoozeFestAlert

10. In reverie did I witness tales of minstrels past within the flickering shadows of my chamber – 'twas a voyage through soundscapes and harmonies that left me yearning for more, alas too late to heed their call! #CleaningChaos

11. In the dim light of evening did I seek refuge in celluloid romance; a gathering most tender with kith and kin as we wove tales of love and laughter 'round the hearth's gentle glow. ❤️🎬 #FamilyNightIn

12. A quill taken up on whim, words flowing like ale from a tavern tap; thus did I compose with fervor – an essay birthed in haste but carrying the weight of passionate curiosity! #ImpracticalDreamer

13. Lured by novelty's siren song, this latest contraption now sits amongst my possessions – a puzzle yet unsolved; shall it be my companion or confounder? Only time will tell... 💡#TechEnthusiastMeetsClueless

14. Alas! My scholarly duties left behind upon the schoolhouse steps, thrice I have faltered in this endeavor – a testament to youthful exuberance or perhaps simply the gravity of arithmetic's allure? #ForgetfulGenius

15. Amidst celestial odysseys cast across the cosmos on my screen did I lose myself; what is time when galaxies unfold before thine eyes, beckoning to unravel their secrets and mysteries yet untold! 🚀 #StarStruck

---

Thus concludes a portrait of my days – an intertwining tapestry of diligence and dalliance, where knowledge is both pursued with earnest zeal and occasionally lost amidst the whimsical follies that life doth present."

1 ([email protected] )"" /><title id=""head-title"">Electrochemistry Question - Identify the Anode and Cathode</title>

# Completed Question
In an electrochemical cell, if zinc (Zn) is one of the electrodes and copper (Cu) is another, with a solution containing Zn2+ ions on one side and Cu2+ ions on the other side:

1. Which electrode acts as the anode?
2. Which electrode acts as the cathode?
3. Write down the half-reactions occurring at each electrode.
4. Determine the overall cell reaction.

# Answer
1. In this electrochemical cell, zinc (Zn) will act as the anode because it is more reactive and has a greater tendency to oxidize than copper (Cu). The anode is where oxidation occurs in an electrochemical cell.

2. Copper (Cu) acts as the cathode since it is less reactive, and reduction will take place here. The cathode is where reduction takes place in an electrochemical cell.

3. Half-reactions:
   - At the anode (Zn): Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e− (oxidation half-reaction)
   - At the cathode (Cu): Cu2+(aq) + 2e− → Cu(s) (reduction half-reaction)

4. The overall cell reaction is obtained by combining both half-reactions: Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s). This represents the spontaneous redox process occurring in the electrochemical cell where zinc metal dissolves and copper ions are deposited as solid copper."

4. **Key Figures**: Identify key figures who have contributed to the development of the idea. These could be philosophers, scientists, artists, inventors, etc., depending on the field related to your concept. Examine their work for insights into how they shaped or influenced the idea.

5. **Influence Analysis**: Study the influences that these key figures may have had upon each other and others in their respective fields. Often ideas are not created in isolation but evolve through dialogue, debate, and collaboration.

18. Had the chance to catch a local band performing last night, supporting my community while enjo Charles Dickens' ""A Tale of Two Cities"" is set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution. The story follows several characters, including Charles Darnay, an aristocrat who renounces his title; Sydney Carton, a dissolute English lawyer who ultimately sacrifices himself for love; Lucie Manette, the object of both men's affections; and Dr. Alexandre Manette, Lucie's father, who was imprisoned in the Bastille for 18 years.

The central themes of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" revolve around resurrection, sacrifice, love, and justice. The French Revolution serves as a backdrop to explore these concepts further. For instance, Dr. Manette's release from prison symbolizes the possibility for rebirth and renewal after years of suffering. Similarly, Sydney Carton's selfless act at the end of the novel is seen as an ultimate sacrifice out of love for Lucie and a way to give meaning to his life.

Moreover, Dickens uses irony and contrast between London and Paris to emphasize social injustices prevalent during that time, such as poverty and oppression leading up to the revolutionary period. Throughout the novel, he also highlights the importance of forgiveness and redemption through characters who show mercy instead of seeking revenge for past wrongdoings.

In summary, ""A Tale of Two Cities"" delves into various themes like love, sacrifice, justice, rebirth, irony, contrast between cities, social injustice, forgiveness, and redemption using the turbulent setting of the French Revolution to explore human nature and its capacity for both evil and good."

Use the formula $A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$ to calculate the amount of money accumulated after two years, where $P$ is the principal amount, $r$ is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), $n$ is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and $t$ is the time in years.
===
To solve this problem, we will use the given formula for compound interest:

\[A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}\]

where:
- \(P\) is the principal amount ($120),
- \(r\) is the annual interest rate (8% or 0.08 in decimal form),
- \(n\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (quarterly compounding means \(n = 4\)),
- \(t\) is the time the money is invested for, in years (2 years).

Plugging in the values, we get:

\[A = 120 \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 2}\]

\[A = 120 \left(1 + 0.02\right)^{8}\]

\[A = 120 \left(1.02\right)^{8}\]

Now we calculate the value of \( (1.02)^8 \) and then multiply by 120 to find the total amount accumulated after two years.

\[(1.02)^8 = 1.171659...\]

Multiplying this by the principal:

\[A = 120 \times 1.171659...\]

\[A = 140.59908...\]

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount accumulated after two years is $140.60."
